# log



think about a decision to check if check_if_json_exist need to be added within functions and not be in main (analyze +-)
    + it will make code and main function more clear
    + it will make functions more atomize
    - it will add more space for mistakes 
force list function to access status regardless capital or non-capital letters
    i should check only the commands: add, update, list, mark, delete. there is no any other things that should be checked, user can use any capitalization of letters in status
    -> and description
add function for change status
add function list with different arguments
add function delete
    fix delete function
added function update
added function add
